## 🚀 Why Reimagine Hacker News?

Hacker News is a beloved hub for tech discussions, but its minimal UI lacks modern usability features such as:

- Mobile responsiveness
- Accessibility options
- Filtering/sorting tools
- Intuitive navigation

This redesign rethinks the UX while staying true to the core values of simplicity and speed.
